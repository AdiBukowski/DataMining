# DataMining
This is my Data Mining class project I've done last year with my colleague Anna Miko≈Çajczyk. The main problem was to detect spam in e-mails, but whole project is a lot more than that and includes comparision of classification and clustering algorithms. Dataset description is included in files. All project is written in RStudio and report is done using R Sweave. I also did R Jupyter notebook with part of analysis for easier insight.
